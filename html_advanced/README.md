# HTML Advanced

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch, based on a design file provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=odbpkpcMXB66kvTC-0). The focus of this project is to build a solid foundation in HTML by crafting an HTML structure without any CSS styling.


## Learning Objectives


### Task 1
Create the basic structure of an HTML page and construct the header based on a provided wireframe.

HTML Skeleton: Start with the foundational HTML5 structure, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

Header Element:

Within the `<body>`, insert the `<header>` tag.

The `<header>` should contain:

A logo: Implement this as an `<a>` tag wrapping an `<img>` tag, where the `<a>` tag points to the homepage.

Navigation links: Three `<a>` tags that serve as navigation. These should be wrapped in a block-level container, such as a `<nav>` or a `<div>`.

### Task 2
Enhance the header by adding a banner that includes multiple text and image elements. This task focuses on structuring content semantically within the header.

Modify the Header:

Inside the `<header>` tag, incorporate a `<section>` element to create a distinct banner area.

Primary Content Block:

Add a `<div>` containing:

A `<h1>` heading for the main title.

A `<p>` tag for a catchy phrase or slogan.

A `<button>` for a call to action, such as registration or sign-up.

Secondary Content Block:

Use a `<h2>` heading for a secondary, supportive title.

Include a `<div>` that houses four smaller blocks, each representing different features:

An `<img>` tag 

A `<h3>` heading for the title of the feature.

A `<p>` tag for a brief description

Add a Main Element:

Below the `<header>`, insert a `<main>` element to separate the main content of the webpage from the header.
