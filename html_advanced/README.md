# HTML Advanced
This project involves creating a webpage from scratch, based on a design file provided in Figma. The focus of this project is to build a solid foundation in HTML by crafting an HTML structure without any CSS styling.

## Learning Objectives

## Task 1
Create the basic structure of an HTML page and construct the header based on a provided wireframe.

### Instructions:

HTML Skeleton: Start with the foundational HTML5 structure, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

Header Element:

Within the `<body>`, insert the `<header>` tag.

The `<header>` should contain:

A logo: Implement this as an `<a>` tag wrapping an `<img>` tag, where the `<a>` tag points to the homepage.

Navigation links: Three `<a>` tags that serve as navigation. These should be wrapped in a block-level container, such as a `<nav>` or a `<div>`.
