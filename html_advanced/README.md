# HTML Advanced

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch, based on a design file provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=odbpkpcMXB66kvTC-0). The focus of this project is to build a solid foundation in HTML by crafting an HTML structure without any CSS styling.

### What is a markup language

### What is the DOM

### What is an element / tag

### What is an attribute

### What the purpose of each HTML tag

## Tasks

### Task 1
Create the basic structure of an HTML page and construct the header based on a provided wireframe.

HTML Skeleton: Start with the foundational HTML5 structure, which includes the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, and the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

Header Element:

Within the `<body>`, insert the `<header>` tag.

The `<header>` should contain:

A logo: Implement this as an `<a>` tag wrapping an `<img>` tag.

Navigation links: Three `<a>` tags that serve as navigation. These should be wrapped in a block-level container, such as a `<nav>` or a `<div>`.

### Task 2
Enhance the header by adding a banner that includes multiple text and image elements. This task focuses on structuring content semantically within the header.

Modify the Header:

Inside the `<header>` tag, incorporate a `<section>` element to create a distinct banner area.

Primary Content Block:

Add a `<div>` containing:

A `<h1>` heading for the main title.

A `<p>` tag for a catchy phrase or slogan.

A `<button>` for a call to action, such as registration.

Secondary Content Block:

Use a `<h2>` heading for a secondary, supportive title.

Include a `<div>` that houses four smaller blocks, each representing different features:

An `<img>` tag 

A `<h3>` heading for the title of the feature.

A `<p>` tag for a brief description

Add a Main Element:

Below the `<header>`, insert a `<main>` element to separate the main content of the webpage from the header.

### Task 3
Incorporate a quote block below the banner within the `<main>` section of the webpage. 

Create a Section for the Quote:

Within the `<main>` element, add a new `<section>` tag for the quote.

Structure of the Quote Block:

Inside the `<section>`, place a `<div>` that will contain all elements related to the quote.

Add an `<img>` tag related to the quote.

Use a `<blockquote>` tag for encapsulating the quoted text, ensuring it is different from other textual content.

Provide a text tag (such as `<p>`) for the quote's author to attribute the quote properly.

Include additional descriptive text `<p>`


### Task 4
Create a section dedicated to showcasing a list of video tutorials. 

Create a new `<section>` element within the `<main>` element to contain all video-related content.

Include a `<h1>` heading at the start of the section to serve as the title of the video list, "Most Popular Tutorials."

Video Blocks:

For each video, create an `<div>` element that encapsulates all the details of the video.

An `<img>` tag for the video's thumbnail, followed by a `<h2>` for the video's title.

Add a `<p>` tag for a description of the video content.

Author Information:

Below the video description provide author details:

Include an image of the author using an `<img>` tag.

Use a `<h3>` tag for the author's name.

Rating System:

Create a rating display using a series of `<img>` tags, each representing a star.

Each star image has an appropriate alt attribute for accessibility, "1 star", "2 stars", etc.

Include additional text `<p>`
